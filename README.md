# Crowdsourcing a Self-Evolving Dialog Graph

This repository contains the code and data used for the analysis in the paper "Crowdsourcing a Self-Evolving Dialog Graph", presented at the first installment of the conference on Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) 2019. Every piece of code and data used is included with the exception of the 200 utterance pairs of alexa-user dialogue, as these are not eligble for sharing. These contents can be found in the Analysis directory, as seen below.


We also include the code that was developed by Team Fantom during the 2018 Alexa Prize. This includes the code for crowdsourcing and the graph structure presented in the CUI paper.

##analysis
Contains: corpora, the processed data used for analysis; raw_corpora, the unprocessed data used for analysis; extractors, the code used to process raw_corpora; and evaluation, the code used to generate and collect results from the experiment interface.
