                This HIT offers you the opportunity to contribute to our university research in Conversational AI.
                In the task you are asked to continue a dialogue while enacting a smart speaker device (such as Amazon Echo, or Google home, or Siri) and at the same time taking on a given personality.
                Each task is estimated to take 90 seconds to complete, but we set the maximum alloted time to 15 minutes for your convenience. We will be posting a large amount of this HIT, which has an expected hourly wage of $8 given that you complete each task in the estimated 90 seconds.
                This HIT requires that you receive a qualification. This can be done by going through our introduction task, which takes about 5 minutes to complete. Also, please make sure to 
                read and follow the persona outlined on the right side of the task for each new HIT.

                        For the purpose of handling named entities in conversations, such as names of movies, musicians, etc., we added a new mechanism to our system - tags. 
                        A tag represents a named entity of a certain category, e.g. a sentence 'I love [Movie Title]' would in conversation be transformed to 'I love Blade Runner'. 
                        Furthermore, we have provided you with additional information about the named entity, that we encourage you to utilise when creating responses. 
                        For movies, you can talk about the director, main actor or genre. 
                        You will see the list of the available tags you can use for a given utterance as boxes that you can drag and drop into the sentence, or just click on them and they will be inserted at where your cursor is at.
